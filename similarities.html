<!--Your site should include at least three web pages with a multi-column layout on each page. 
Include properly-formatted images and appropriately-marked up text and continue to define sections 
of content with HTML semantic elements. 
Add a self-hosted web font to your pages (not Google or Adobe Fonts) with the CSS @font-face rule.

Use the CSS Grid Layout Module for the overall layout of each page. 
Also use the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module (Flexbox) at least once on each page to 
arrange items along one axis. 
You can feel free to use the same general layout for every page of the site but you don’t need to.-->

                    <p>In <span style="color:blueviolet">"Dust in the Wind"</span>, when Wan and Huen move to the city,
                        they do not become “rebels against
                        [urban]
                        society”
                        (Teo
                        2006) but rather they are the majority who want to have this Taiwan dream of getting rich from
                        the
                        city.
                        However, due to the cultural clashes between urban and rural life, both face trouble adjusting
                        to
                        their
                        new
                        environment. Eventually, they become aware that they do not belong to this urban life through
                        their
                        observations
                        of living in Taipei. Ultimately, the constant pressure of trying to assimilate into society not
                        only
                        destroys
                        their dream together but strains and ruins their relationship with each other.
