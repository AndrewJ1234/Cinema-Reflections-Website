<!--Your site should include at least three web pages with a multi-column layout on each page. 
Include properly-formatted images and appropriately-marked up text and continue to define sections 
of content with HTML semantic elements. 
Add a self-hosted web font to your pages (not Google or Adobe Fonts) with the CSS @font-face rule.

Use the CSS Grid Layout Module for the overall layout of each page. 
Also use the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module (Flexbox) at least once on each page to 
arrange items along one axis. 
You can feel free to use the same general layout for every page of the site but you don’t need to.-->

                    <p>Hsiao-hsien centers on the men's jobs: working in the mine, and going
                        to
                        the military, only
                        briefly,
                        showcasing
                        the women’s jobs. More importantly, the director underscores that both the man and the woman
                        work.
                        Whereas
                        in
                        <span style="color:blueviolet">"Money and
                            Honey"</span>, the documentary primarily focuses on the woman’s job as a caretaker.
                        Because
                        the
                        woman
                        laborers
                        are the main 'breadwinners', they become caretakers of others instead of their children to
                        provide
                        for
                        their
                        children’s education back in their home country (Zhang 203-204).
