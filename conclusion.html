<!--Your site should include at least three web pages with a multi-column layout on each page. 
Include properly-formatted images and appropriately-marked up text and continue to define sections 
of content with HTML semantic elements. 
Add a self-hosted web font to your pages (not Google or Adobe Fonts) with the CSS @font-face rule.

Use the CSS Grid Layout Module for the overall layout of each page. 
Also use the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module (Flexbox) at least once on each page to 
arrange items along one axis. 
You can feel free to use the same general layout for every page of the site but you donâ€™t need to.-->

                    <p>In summary, in both films, "Money and Honey" as well as,"Dust in the
                        Wind", we see great overarching themes of
                        love being confronted with choice. The choice to provide for a family by nurturing or by
                        working. Or
                        the
                        choice to dwell in the rural or the urban. In both films, we see hard situations, and in both
                        films,
                        we
                        see
                        hard decisions to match them. So in conclusion, through their melodramatic plots, these stories
                        both
                        take a
                        hard look at the cultures from which they came and find familiar elements of both family and
                        love.
